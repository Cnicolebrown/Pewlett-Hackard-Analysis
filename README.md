#"Silver Tsunami Preparation"

--Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of employees retiring along with their corresponding position. This will help to determine the number of positions that would require filling and allow for the training of their replacements. Finally, a mentorship eligibility count was created to determine employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. This will help identify those who can replace the employees who are leaving their position due to retirement and provide a candidate pool that can replace them. 

#Results: 
1.	The general staff employee has the highest count of retirements.

2. The lowest amount of staff retirement are assistant engineers. 
3. Staff mentorship has the highest number of candidates that are eligible for the mentorship program. 
4. Conversely assistant engineer has the smallest amount of candidates as well. 

#Summary: 
In total, 90,398 positions will need to be filled in order to withstand the silver tsunami. In total there are 1,940 candidates that are eligible for the mentorship program. This leaves a total of 88,458 positions that will need to be filled with candidates externally. In order to work to stave off the silver tsunami beginning the mentorship program and hiring process quickly will be crucial for the company. Internal promotions would also benefit, along with continuing education in order for employees who almost have the right qualifications for certain positions can gain the necessary education and skills for promotions.
